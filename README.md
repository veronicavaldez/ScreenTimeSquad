## ScreenTimeSquad

### Problem and Motivation
Millions of mobile phone users in the modern day face issues with high
screen time. Although companies such as Apple have implemented
restrictive features to help reduce screen time, the addictive nature of
smartphones continues to pose a threat to productivity and real-life social
interaction. Excessive phone usage also contributes to the ongoing mental
health crisis: a 2019 study found that adolescents who spend more than three hours
daily on social media are more likely to suffer from mental health issues such as
depression or isolation 1. Our program, ScreenTimeSquad, provides a lighthearted
and fun way for friends to hold each other accountable for screen time, seeking to
solve this widespread problem. By utilizing a leaderboard system for ranking, a comparison
of algorithms to highlight program efficiency, and by displaying user-app data by category,
our program offers a fun, refreshing, and quick way to monitor personal and interpersonal screen usage.
